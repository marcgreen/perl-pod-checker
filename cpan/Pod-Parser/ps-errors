=item * Deleting unknown formatting code $was<>

TODO

=item * You can extend only formatting codes A-Z, not like "$new_letter"

=item * You can't extend an established code like "$new_letter"

Extended formatting codes must match /[A-Z]/ and cannot be an established code

=item * Format for second =extend parameter must be like M or 1 or 0 or M,N or M,N,O but you have it like $fallbacks_one

=item * Format for third =extend parameter: like foo or bar,Baz,qu:ux but not like $elements_one

Erroneously formatted =extend param

=item * Can't use unknown formatting code '$f' as a fallback for '$new_letter'

Self explanatory

=item * Unknown =extend syntax: $content

Extensor has bad syntax

=item * A non-empty Z<>

=item * An empty L<>

=item * An empty E<>

Self explanatory

=item * An E<...> surrounding strange content

TODO

=item * Unknown E content in E<$content>

E content must return a match from Pod::Escapes::e2charnum

=item * Couldn't do %s: %s

TODO something about encoding

=item * Invalid =encoding syntax: $content

Syntax error in =encoding directive

=item * You forgot a '=back' before '$para_type'

No =headNs allowed inside an =over block

=item * '=item' outside of any '=over'

=item * You can't have =items (as at line xxx) unless the first thing after the =over is an =item

Self explanatory

=item * Expected '=item $expected_value'

=item * Expected '=item *'

Incorrect =item type (e.g., a bullet when a number is expected)

=item * You have '=item x instead of the expected '=item $expected_value'

Erroneous numbering of =item numbers

=item * Unknown directive: $para->[0]

There are a limited number of POD directives, chap, try picking one that exists

=item * =for without a target?

Self explanatory

=item * =begin without a target?

Self explanatory

=item * '=end' without a target?

TODO is that necessary?

=item * '=end $content' is invalid.

$content needs to be one word

=item * =end $content without matching =begin.

Throw in a C<=begin> there, buddy, and I<then> try C<=end>ing

=item * =end $content doesn't match =begin.

$content needs to match =begin's target

=item * =pod directives shouldn't be over one line long!  Ignoring all x lines of content

Self explanatory

=item * =over is the last thing in the document?!

That is not allowed

=item * Can't have a 0 in =over $content

You thought I<that> was a good idea? To indent 0 spaces? Sheesh, try a positive number next time.

=item * =over should be: '=over' or '=over positive_number'

Self explanatory

=item * =back doesn't take any parameters, but you said =back $content

That was mean, take it back! Next time don't parameterize C<=back>, okay?

=item * =back without =over

You need to go C<=over> before you can come C<=back>

=item * '=item' outside of any '=over'

You want to put that C<=item> I<where>? It belongs inside an C<=over>/C<=back> block.

=item * You can't have =items (as at line xxx) unless the first thing after the =over is an =item

Self explanatory

=item * Unterminated $x sequence

All sequences needed to be closed TODO

=back

=head2 Screams

=over 4

=item * UTF16-BE Byte Encoding Mark found; but Pod::Simple v$Pod::Simple::VERSION doesn't implement UTF16 yet.

=item * UTF16-LE Byte Encoding Mark found; but Pod::Simple v$Pod::Simple::VERSION doesn't implement UTF16 yet.

Self explanatory

=item * =cut found outside a pod block.  Skipping to next block.

Self explanatory

=item * This document probably does not appear as it should, because its "=encoding $e" line calls for an unsupported encoding. I<Suggestion here.> I<Supported encodings here.>

Self explanatory
