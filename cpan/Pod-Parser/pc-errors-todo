=head2 Errors

=over 4

=item * Nested =begin's

There were at least two consecutive C<=begin> commands without
the corresponding C<=end>. Only one C<=begin> may be active at
a time.

=item * unresolved internal link I<NAME>

The given link to I<NAME> does not have a matching node in the current
POD. This also happened when a single word node name is not enclosed in
C<"">.

=item * nested commands I<CMD>E<lt>...I<CMD>E<lt>...E<gt>...E<gt>

Two nested identical markup commands have been found. Generally this
does not make sense.

=item * garbled entity I<STRING>

The I<STRING> found cannot be interpreted as a character entity.

=item * malformed link LE<lt>E<gt>

The link found cannot be parsed because it does not conform to the
syntax described in L<perlpod>.

=item * nonempty ZE<lt>E<gt>

The C<ZE<lt>E<gt>> sequence is supposed to be empty.

=item * empty XE<lt>E<gt>

The index entry specified contains nothing but whitespace.

=head2 Warnings

These may not necessarily cause trouble, but indicate mediocre style.

=over 4

=item * multiple occurrence of link target I<name>

The POD file has some C<=item> and/or C<=head> commands that have
the same text. Potential hyperlinks to such a text cannot be unique then.
This warning is printed only with warning level greater than one.

=item * line containing nothing but whitespace in paragraph

There is some whitespace on a seemingly empty line. POD is very sensitive
to such things, so this is flagged. B<vi> users switch on the B<list>
option to avoid this problem.

=begin _disabled_

=item * file does not start with =head

The file starts with a different POD directive than head.
This is most probably something you do not want.

=end _disabled_

=item * =item type mismatch (I<one> vs. I<two>)

A list started with e.g. a bullet-like C<=item> and continued with a
numbered one. This is obviously inconsistent. For most translators the
type of the I<first> C<=item> determines the type of the list.

=item * I<N> unescaped C<E<lt>E<gt>> in paragraph

Angle brackets not written as C<E<lt>ltE<gt>> and C<E<lt>gtE<gt>>
can potentially cause errors as they could be misinterpreted as
markup commands. This is only printed when the -warnings level is
greater than 1.

=item * Unknown entity

A character entity was found that does not belong to the standard
ISO set or the POD specials C<verbar> and C<sol>.

=item * No argument for =item

C<=item> without any parameters is deprecated. It should either be followed
by C<*> to indicate an unordered list, by a number (optionally followed
by a dot) to indicate an ordered (numbered) list or simple text for a
definition list.

=back

=head2 Hyperlinks

=over

=item * ignoring leading/trailing whitespace in link

There is whitespace at the beginning or the end of the contents of L<...>.

=item * alternative text/node '%s' contains non-escaped | or /

The characters | and / are special in the L<...> context. Although the hyperlink parser does its best to determine which "/" is text and which is a delimiter in case of doubt, one ought to escape these literal characters like this:

      /     E<sol>
      |     E<verbar>

=back

=head1 IN POD::SIMPLE ALREADY

=head2 Errors

=over

=item * =over on line I<N> without closing =back

The C<=over> command does not have a corresponding C<=back> before the
next heading (C<=head1> or C<=head2>) or the end of the file.

=item * =item without previous =over

=item * =back without previous =over

An C<=item> or C<=back> command has been found outside a
C<=over>/C<=back> block.

=item * No argument for =begin

A C<=begin> command was found that is not followed by the formatter
specification.

=item * =end without =begin

A standalone C<=end> command was found.

=item * =for without formatter specification

There is no specification of the formatter after the C<=for> command.

=item * Unknown command "I<CMD>"

An invalid POD command has been found. Valid are C<=head1>, C<=head2>,
C<=head3>, C<=head4>, C<=over>, C<=item>, C<=back>, C<=begin>, C<=end>,
C<=for>, C<=pod>, C<=cut>

=item * Unknown interior-sequence "I<SEQ>"

An invalid markup command has been encountered. Valid are:
C<BE<lt>E<gt>>, C<CE<lt>E<gt>>, C<EE<lt>E<gt>>, C<FE<lt>E<gt>>,
C<IE<lt>E<gt>>, C<LE<lt>E<gt>>, C<SE<lt>E<gt>>, C<XE<lt>E<gt>>,
C<ZE<lt>E<gt>>

=item * Spurious text after =pod / =cut

The commands C<=pod> and C<=cut> do not take any arguments.

=item * Spurious character(s) after =back

The C<=back> command does not take any arguments.

=back

=head2 Warnings (reported as errors in Pod::Simple though, fix this)

=item * preceding non-item paragraph(s)

A list introduced by C<=over> starts with a text or verbatim paragraph,
but continues with C<=item>s. Move the non-item paragraph out of the
C<=over>/C<=back> block.
